               * Danmakufu Simplescript (DSS) Documentation (Version 1)
               * Updated Tue Jun 22 12:51:22 CDT 2010

Intro: 
Danmakufu Simplescript is a "second look" at the idea of customized 
Touhou levels. It is different from Danmakufu's Language, to the point that an 
automated converter is probably impossible to create. SimpleScript (DSS) is not 
a programming language, in that it is not possible to control the "Game Engine" 
into producing behaviors it could not already do. Rather, DSS is made to be run 
on top of an engine that offers a full suite of features, and the script needs 
merely select which ones to "engage." Expert users may find this idea 
restrictive. For those having this preconception, I encourage you to actually 
dive in to the quick tutorials below. DSS is essentially XML script, in a 
condensed format. By condensed, I really mean that each node of the data Tree 
(if you aren't familiar with text based trees, check out a quick book on XML 
format) corresponds 99% of the time to an entity that will actually appear, on 
screen, in your level. Nodes of the tree can be of one of a few predetermined 
classes, but may be arbitrarily nested. The nesting of nodes (heiarchical 
relationships) is significant, and the possible nesting effects will become 
clear in the explanation below. Finally, if this document serves to frustrate or 
overwhelm you in detail, just remember that I intend users to learn DSS by trial 
and error, by copy and paste, and by putting thoughts to paper. Not by reading 
the docs. ENJOY 

Claim: 
For every dream you can have, DSS will enable you to put it into action 
before the end of the universe. 

Definition of a Syntax Parser: 
A machine which reads in your DSS, and interprets how 
it's going to run your touhou level. It will yell at you if you give it slop, 
and will try to help you fix problems. Using the editor, you will be able to see 
the feedback the parser gives you, and hopefully correctly interpret what the 
syntax parser is telling you. All in all, there must be 2 way communication 
between you and the parser in order for the coding to go smoothly. 

Structure of a DSS script: 
A DSS Script is a tree of nodes. The function of a 
node at play-time is determined by 3 factors: 1) The location of the node. - 
Many nodes will be "Top Level". That is, they will not be nested inside any 
other node. 

Structure of a Node: 
A Node has key value pairs, or nested nodes. 
SYNTAX:
<class> <name> 
     <key> = <value>
     <key> = <value>
\ <value, wrapping to second line>
\ <and so on.>
}
__ END SYNTAX    
Where the '<>' mean "insert your word here". All punctuation needed is shown above.
Line returns are significant, and required. The facing left curly brace ends the node it matches to
on the stack. A facing right curly brace is not necessary to begin a node, but is common.
See "Comments" to discover that comments can go anywhere.

Nested nodes are created in the same syntax as a normal node, placed inside of the curly braces.

Structure of a Key Value Pair:
Keys are case sensitive, and must be one of the parameters specified at the end of this 
guide. Values are, well, rather unbounded in form.

Comments on Comments:
The parser's view on comments, is that any text which does not resemble a syntactic
structure is a comment. If the text being parsed resembles a syntactic structure,
but is not parsable, then the parser yells at you. Thus, there is a fine line between
text that looks like it may be parsable, but contains errors, and text that is meant
to be comments. 99% of the time, if you just write reasonable comments, it will recognize
them as such and not parse them in. The other 1% of the time, add a # character at the beginning
of the line, so it REALLY knows it's a comment. I've never had to do this, yet.

Saved DSS files:
DSS script is text based, so one could theoretically copy the code (the in game editor
supports copy and paste, so you know) and email it to a friend on the Usenet. However,
I was lieing if I implied that a touhou level can be represented entirely in text. Of
course there are graphics and many other lovely things! Thus, there is a format which
should be used to distribute DSS scripts which will have no file extension. This format
consists of garbled characters, which encodes for both the DSS script and any other
metadata that the editor generates and are necessary for your level. You may try to 
decrypt this format, be my guest. However, the most important detail is that this 
format is predetermined (as of may 2009) , and will NEVER BE CHANGED. To see an example
of why more than just the text script is needed, see the Graphics sections below.

Graphics:
I have a personal annoyance with scripts that make you do things like this:
FlandreAnimation = 
     [Flandre.gif[100,100,50,50,@HORIZ_FLIP], 20, 
      Flandre.gif[130,100,50,50,@HORIZ_FLIP], 20,
      Flandre.gif[160,100,50,50,@HORIZ_FLIP], 20 ]
just to represent a sprite. Writing the pixel locations by hand like this is 
prone to error making, and when you're adding 50+ sprites to a level, this gets
old really fast. DSS handles this problem by adding Visual Metadata to some classes
of nodes. Specifically, for nodes that represent an entity on the screen (most of them),
the editor provides a button which can be used to 
  1) Select which image you would like to use (Can be a whole "tilemap", and can be shared)
  2) Drag a rectangle around individual animation frames 
     - Before you freak out, you CAN set the grid resolution, so that you get the tiles
       perfectly 16x16 or whatever you have designed. I know the mouse is not perfect.

As described above, visual metadata such as this (the file paths, and the animation frames)
are contained (along with everything else) in the hashed format which you are given when you press "save".

Addressing Nodes:
In the exceedingly rare case that you need to address one of the nodes in the script
tree absolutely (some of the more advanced features require this), then the address
of any node can be formed by taking a path from the root node to the node, and appending
the names of the nodes on this path with '.' delimiters.

For instance, if "a" held "b" which held "c", the address of "c" would be a.b.c
(period, end of sentence)

Addresses of nodes are non case sensitive.

Now for the rest of the documentation, which is technical, and will be autowritten by the computer.

spellcard
=======
   *** ALL KEYS ARE CASE SeNsItIvE ***   

addBgs
---------

Backgrounds which are nested in a SpellCard are automatically rendered as part 
of this spellcard. However, if you would like to use the backgrounds from 
elsewhere in your script (say, a background that's in the top level) you may 
list their paths (comma seperated) here. This is especially useful for 
background videos - Each background node represents a link to a movie file, and 
it will be cached. Future references to any background node (even if they are in 
different spellcards) will use the same cache, which is better for performance 
(this does not occur if you copy and paste the URL of the movie into multiple 
background nodes...). Using this parameter may be preferable to nesting 
backgrounds in spellcards, since backgrounds have a high re-use potential. 
Either way, I try to keep the memory overhead pretty low with the background 
videos, so don't worry too much about duplication if it's necessary.

duration
---------

(1) -1 duration = 0 makes the card never end (2) duration = -1 makes the card 
end after the boss sustains -duration damage. (3) duration > 0 makes the card 
end after duration time In all cases, duration can be in beats or seconds. The 
beat flag is only paid attention to in case 3.
Defaults to (without quotes), '-.5'

health
---------

Size of the Boss's healthbar.
+ Valid only if parameter > 0 (strictly)
Defaults to (without quotes), '1'

level_h
---------

height of the playing area. Unlike the Level node's version of this parameter, 
this one is an expression, and so can change. When not defined (or empty 
string), the height is taken from the Level node.
Defaults to (without quotes), ''

level_w
---------

width of the playing area. Unlike the Level node's version of this parameter, 
this one is an expression, and so can change. When not defined (or empty 
string), the width is taken from the Level node.
Defaults to (without quotes), ''

level_xo
---------

horizontal center of the playing area. This is an expression. When not defined, 
the stage is sensibly fit to be slightly to the left, with all of it onscreen.
Defaults to (without quotes), ''

level_yo
---------

vertical center of the playing area. This is an expression. When not defined, 
the stage is centered vertically.
Defaults to (without quotes), ''

name
---------

+ REQUIRED in order to compile spellcard

orientation
---------

Rotation (orientation) of the playing area. Rotation is about the center of the 
playing area. Bullets fired in a modified orientation will continue to "fly" in 
the direction of the old orientation even if the orientation is updated. This is 
a feature I purposefully added, not a bug. This is an expression.

 which may be defined piecewise or iteratively.

Defaults to (without quotes), 'n'

bombCost
---------

When a shot is fired as a bomb, specifies what cost the player pays. Positive

 which may be defined piecewise or iteratively.
Defaults to (without quotes), '.05'

h_tex
---------

+ Valid only if parameter > 0 (strictly)
Defaults to (without quotes), '5'

harmful
---------

Specifies whether contact with a player harms the player. No for powerups.

linktime
---------

Sets when to run the Neighboring algorithms.

neighbors
---------

+ Valid only if parameter correctly represents one of the ways to filter out a bullet's "neighbors".

+ Valid only if parameter can be evaluated to a Yes or No. Specifically, the following characters are looked for: [yt1] = yes, [nf0] = no
Defaults to (without quotes), 'y'

relative
---------

Relativity: Sets the origin for the coordinates generated by the position 
expressions.
+ Valid only if parameter is one of topleft, topright, bottomright, bottomleft, center, source, sourcelock, or player
Defaults to (without quotes), 'source'

rotate
---------

In the rectangular coordinate modes, this is the rotation of the bullet glyph. 
An expression.
+ Valid only if parameter represents a computable expression, using only defined variables,
 which may be defined piecewise or iteratively.
Defaults to (without quotes), '0'

sound
---------

Specifies which sound plays when this bullet is spawned. The choices are any of 
the sound constants in the "globals" node, whether they are also used for 
another purpose in the level is irrelevent.
Defaults to (without quotes), ''

store
---------

The "Store" updating expression. (Used in the "neighboring bullets" algorithms)
+ Valid only if parameter represents a computable expression, using only defined variables,
 which may be defined piecewise or iteratively.

+ Valid only if parameter represents a computable expression, using only defined variables,
 which may be defined piecewise or iteratively.
Defaults to (without quotes), '1'

tintB
---------

Tints the blue color component of the bullet sprite, 0-1. An expression.
+ Valid only if parameter represents a computable expression, using only defined variables,
 which may be defined piecewise or iteratively.
